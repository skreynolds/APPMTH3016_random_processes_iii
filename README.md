# APPMTH3016 Random Processes III
This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of random processes, particularly continuous-time Markov chains, and related structures. These are the essential building blocks of any random system, be it a telecommunications network, a hospital waiting list or a transport system. They also arise in many other environments, where you wish to capture the development of some element of random behaviour over time, such as the state of the surrounding environment. Topics covered are:
* **Continuous-time Markov-chains**: definition and basic properties; transient behaviour; the stationary distribution; hitting probabilities and expected hitting times; and reversibility.
* **Queueing Networks**: Kendall's notation; Jackson networks; and mean;
* **Loss Networks**: truncated reversible processes; circuit-switched networks; and reduced load approximations.
* **Basic Queueing Theory**: arrival processes; service time distributions; and Little's Law.
* **Point Processes**: Poisson process; properties and generalisations;
* **Renewal Processes**: preliminaries; renewal function; renewal theory and applications; stationary and delayed renewal processes.
